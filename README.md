# Leaf MeterüçÉ
A big thank you to our team members for making this project a success:

This project is part of the **Project Mandiri Lintas Disiplin (PMLD)** course. The outcome is a tool that automatically measures leaf dimensions for up to 3 leaves using **YOLOv8 instance segmentation**.

## Components and Software
This project involves three main components:
- **Raspberry Pi 4B**: Serves as both the computer and microcontroller.
- **Camera**: (Exact specifications unknown) Captures images for analysis.
- **Time-of-Flight Sensor (VL53L0X)**: A laser-based distance sensor for accurate measurements.

For the interface, we used QTDesigner to create and design the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
